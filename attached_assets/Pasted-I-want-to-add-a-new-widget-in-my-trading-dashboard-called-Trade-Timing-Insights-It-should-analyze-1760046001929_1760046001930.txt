I want to add a new widget in my trading dashboard called “Trade Timing Insights.”
It should analyze all my trades and show what times of day I tend to perform best and worst.
The widget must match the current dashboard’s dark theme and visual style (deep navy background, cyan/green gradients, rounded cards, subtle glow).

Functionality Requirements:

Data Input

Use existing trade logs (from Supabase or local JSON — wherever trades are stored).

Each trade record has an open_time, close_time, and pnl (profit/loss) value.

Extract the hour from the open_time in local timezone.

Data Processing

Group all trades by hour (00–23).

For each hour, calculate:

total_trades

average_pnl

win_rate (percentage of profitable trades)

Identify:

best_hour → highest average PnL

worst_hour → lowest average PnL

Display Options (two parts):
A. Summary Cards (top)

Example text:

🟢 Best Trading Hour: 09:00–11:00 | Avg +$2.1K | Win 81%
🔴 Worst Trading Hour: 14:00–16:00 | Avg -$700 | Win 34%


Styled like the other info cards (rounded, subtle glow, blue background).

Auto-updates as new trades come in.

B. Hourly Profit Chart (below)

Horizontal chart showing hours on X-axis (0–23) and average PnL on Y-axis.

Positive hours → glowing cyan/green.

Negative hours → glowing red.

Tooltip on hover: 09:00 | +$2,100 avg | 12 trades | 81% win.

Chart should be responsive and use the same library as the existing PnL chart (Recharts or Chart.js).

Integration

Place this widget below or next to the “Long vs Short Performance” section in the dashboard grid.

Title: Trade Timing Insights

Add an optional short insight line below the chart, e.g.:

“You perform 4× better between 8–11 AM. Avoid trades after 2 PM.”

Style Notes

Match all other widgets’ styling:

Rounded corners

#0A1633 or #0F1E44 background

Gradient text or glow accents (cyan → purple)

Font size consistent with “Profit / Win Rate” cards.

Bonus (if easy to add):

Toggle to switch between local time and UTC for global users.

Hover highlighting over chart bars that correspond to best/worst hours.

Deliverables:

✅ Fully functional widget integrated in dashboard
✅ Responsive design (desktop first)
✅ Fetches live trade data from Supabase
✅ Summary cards + visual chart rendered cleanly
