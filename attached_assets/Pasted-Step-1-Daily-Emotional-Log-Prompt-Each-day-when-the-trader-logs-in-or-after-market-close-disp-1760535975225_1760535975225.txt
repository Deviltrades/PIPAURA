Step 1 — Daily Emotional Log Prompt

Each day, when the trader logs in (or after market close), display a small modal:

🗓 “How are you feeling today?”

Ask 3–4 quick inputs:

1️⃣ Mood Slider (1–10)

“Overall emotional state today”

1 = Very negative

10 = Very positive

Save as numeric (emotion_score).

2️⃣ Energy Level (1–10)

“How focused / energized do you feel?”

Tracks fatigue, burnout, or overhype trends.

3️⃣ Keywords (Checkboxes or Tags)

“Select words that describe your emotional state”
Example:

😤 Frustrated   😐 Neutral   😎 Confident   😰 Anxious
🔥 Motivated    💤 Tired     😔 Doubtful    💪 Disciplined


Store as an array (for tagging + analytics heatmap).

4️⃣ Optional Journal Note (Textarea)

“Anything on your mind today?”
→ Stores free text, optional, sentiment can later be analyzed by AI.

📊 Step 2 — Emotional Analytics Dashboard

Once data is logged, you can show patterns like this:

🧩 Visuals
Widget	Description
📈 Mood vs Win Rate Chart	Correlate emotional score with daily performance.
🔁 Emotional Volatility Gauge	Shows how stable their emotions are week-to-week.
🌈 Mood Heatmap (Calendar)	Colored calendar cells: green = high mood, red = low.
🧩 Keyword Frequency Cloud	Visual of most-used emotion tags (“anxious”, “confident”, etc.).
🔔 Behavioral Alerts	“Confidence dropped 3 days in a row — take it slow tomorrow.”
🕹 Step 3 — Data Storage (for Replit / Supabase)

Create a new table:

CREATE TABLE emotional_logs (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES user_profiles(id),
  date date DEFAULT current_date,
  mood integer CHECK (mood BETWEEN 1 AND 10),
  energy integer CHECK (energy BETWEEN 1 AND 10),
  tags text[],
  note text,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);


You can easily pull this into analytics with:

SELECT date, mood, energy FROM emotional_logs WHERE user_id = current_user ORDER BY date DESC;

⚡ Step 4 — Analytics Logic

You can compute a “Trader Sentiment Index” (TSI):

TSI = (mood * 0.6) + (energy * 0.4)


Then smooth it over 7 days with EWMA:

TSI_smoothed = 0.7 * prev + 0.3 * current


Display:

7.5 → Optimal mindset

4–7 → Neutral / watch for tilt

< 4 → Emotional fatigue risk

❤️ Bonus: Correlation Engine

You can automatically correlate emotion_score vs performance each week:

SELECT corr(emotion_score, daily_return)
FROM emotional_logs JOIN trade_results USING (date)
WHERE user_id = current_user;


→ Output example:

“Your emotional state correlates 0.68 with profitability (positive). You trade best when your mood > 7.”
