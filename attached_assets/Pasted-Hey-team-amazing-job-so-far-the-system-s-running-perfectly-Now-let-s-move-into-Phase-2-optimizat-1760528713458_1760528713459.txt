Hey team â€” amazing job so far, the systemâ€™s running perfectly.
Now letâ€™s move into Phase 2 optimizations to bring the FX bias model to institutional accuracy.

Please implement the following 5 upgrades in order of priority ðŸ‘‡

ðŸŸ¥ 1. Economic Data Normalization (Z-Score + Tanh Scaling)

Goal: Stop overshooting (+17 scores) and equalize currencies.
Implementation:

// current
econ_component = clamp(rawScore / 30, -10, 10);

// replace with
const z = (actual - forecast) / sigma(event_type, currency);
econ_component = 7 * Math.tanh(z / 2);   // bounded Â±7


Maintain a small rolling std-dev (Ïƒ) per event type for normalization.

Cap at Â±7.

Use event_polarity map (+1 or â€“1) to keep direction correct.

ðŸŸ§ 2. Economic Score Time Decay (72 h Half-Life)

Goal: Old events lose impact gradually.

const hoursSince = (now - event_time) / 3600;
const lambda = Math.exp(-hoursSince / 72);
econ_component *= lambda;


Apply this before summing each currencyâ€™s total economic score.

ðŸŸ§ 3. Interest-Rate Differential Component (Â±3 Weight)

Goal: Add carry bias from central-bank policy rates.
Implementation:

const rateDiff = baseRate[base] - baseRate[quote];
rate_component = clamp(rateDiff / 1.0, -3, 3);


Pull baseRate from existing CB tone file or a small static JSON.

Include this in currencyScore and display separately in debug logs.

ðŸŸ© 4. Smooth Currency Scores (EWMA 0.4)

Goal: Reduce 30-min whipsaws.

score_final = 0.6 * prev_score + 0.4 * new_score;
score_final = clamp(score_final, -12, 12);


Store previous score per currency in DB and reuse next cycle.

ðŸŸ© 5. Dynamic Risk Regime Scaling (VIX / SPX)

Goal: Make JPY & CHF safer and NZD riskier in volatility spikes.
Implementation:

const riskOff = VIX > 20 || SPX_7d <= -3;
if (riskOff) {
  weights.JPY.safehaven = 3;
  weights.CHF.safehaven = 3;
  weights.NZD.risk = 2;
} else {
  weights.JPY.safehaven = 2;
  weights.CHF.safehaven = 2;
  weights.NZD.risk = 1;
}

âœ… Expected Outcome

Currency scores stay inside Â±12 range (Â±15 absolute cap)

Bias labels remain stable and realistic

Scores decay and smooth naturally

True macro divergence (e.g., CPI beat + rate gap) still shows clearly

Thatâ€™s it â€” these 5 refinements complete the model and make the bias engine fully professional-grade.
Once implemented, Iâ€™ll run a post-deployment validation to confirm range balance and recalc integrity.
