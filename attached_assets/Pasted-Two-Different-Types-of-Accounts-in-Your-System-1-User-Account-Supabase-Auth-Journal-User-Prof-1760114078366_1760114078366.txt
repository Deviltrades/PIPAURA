Two Different Types of “Accounts” in Your System
1️⃣ User Account (Supabase Auth / Journal User Profile)

This is the person who owns the journal — a real human who logs in, pays, and has their own workspace.

Stored in → user_profiles (linked to auth.users)

Created when → user registers or purchases your journal

Contains → name, email, subscription plan, purchase type, etc.

Think of this as:

“The customer who owns the whole journal dashboard.”

2️⃣ Trading Account (within the Journal)

This is an account the trader uses to trade in real life — demo, live, or prop —
and they can have multiple of these under one user profile.

Stored in → trade_accounts

Created when → user manually adds it in the Trading Accounts page

Contains → account type, broker name, starting balance, etc.

Always linked to → user_id from the journal user profile

Think of this as:

“The trading accounts that belong to the journal user.”

🔗 The Relationship (This Is Key)
1 User → Many Trading Accounts → Many Trades

Visually:

user_profiles
   │
   ├── trade_accounts
   │       ├── trades
   │       ├── trades
   │       └── trades

   ├── trade_accounts
   │       ├── trades
   │       └── trades
   │
   └── trade_accounts
           └── trades

In Database Terms:

user_profiles.id → unique for each journal owner

trade_accounts.user_id → links back to that profile

trades.account_id → links back to the trade account it came from

✅ Example Data Flow
Table	Example Entry
user_profiles	{ id: user_123, name: "Bro", plan: "Pro" }
trade_accounts	{ id: acc_456, user_id: user_123, broker_name: "FTMO", type: "prop", balance: 10000 }
trades	{ id: t_789, account_id: acc_456, pair: "XAUUSD", pnl: 350 }

Result:

The journal knows these trades belong to FTMO

FTMO belongs to you (user_123)

All analytics, filters, and aggregation can be run by user_id

🧠 What You Should Tell Replit (Copy/Paste This)

⚙️ “There are two separate layers of accounts in my system.

The user account (created on registration or purchase) → stored in user_profiles, tied to Supabase Auth.

The trading accounts (demo, prop, live, etc.) → stored in trade_accounts, linked to the user via user_id.

Each user can have multiple trading accounts, and each trading account can have multiple trades.
All trade_accounts and trades must include a user_id foreign key so data remains isolated per journal user.”

That’s the exact wording Replit needs — otherwise they’ll mix the concepts and tie trade accounts directly to Auth users without using the user_profiles layer, which will break your structure later (especially for analytics, subscriptions, or custom user tiers).
