🧩 2️⃣ USER-CREATED TAG SYSTEM

Traders should be able to:

Create unlimited custom tags (text-based)

Assign color to each tag (🎨 color = tag type / emotion / category)

Apply up to 3–5 tags per trade

Filter or group by tag combinations

💡 UX Flow

“Add Tag” Modal

Input: Tag name

Color selector (default blue, red, green, yellow, purple)

Category dropdown (Strategy / Emotion / Market / Custom)

Save → instantly adds to sidebar

Tag Display

Show tags as colored pills (rounded badges) under trade cards

Hover = full tag description

🧠 3️⃣ ADVANCED FILTER LOGIC (Elite-Level Feature)

Allow multi-layer conditions:

Tag includes “Pivot Reversal” AND “London Session”

Tag includes “Overconfident” AND Result = Loss

Tag includes “Aligned with Bias” AND Profit > 2R

This creates behavioral pattern discovery automatically.

🧱 4️⃣ TECH IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (for your Replit/Supabase stack)

Table	trade_tags with columns: id, user_id, trade_id, tag, color, category
Filter Query	Use Supabase’s @> ARRAY[] for tag array filtering
UI Components	Shadcn <Badge> components with Tailwind glow (color-coded)
Storage	Each trade can store tags in an array column (Postgres text[])

select * from trades where tags @> '{Pivot Reversal}'
``` |

## 🧠 5️⃣ BONUS — AI-ASSISTED TAGGING (Phase 2)

Let Pipaura suggest tags automatically using metadata:
> “This trade aligns with your ‘Liquidity Sweep’ setup and was executed during London session with high volatility — add suggested tags?”

Adds auto-tagging from:
- Session time  
- ADR %  
- Bias alignment  
- RSI / Power indicator states

## 🎨 6️⃣ VISUAL STYLE (Pipaura Consistency)

- Dark background  
- Glowing tag borders (cyan / magenta / gold)  
- Hover animation (scale 1.03 + soft glow)  
- Searchable dropdown for tag filters  
- “Add New Tag” button always pinned to top of tag list

If you want, I can now **design your full “Tag Filter System Blueprint” (React + Supabase)** — including the data schema, UI flow, and filtering query logic — so it’s plug-and-play ready inside your dashboard.  

Would you like me to build that next, bro?
