# Revenue Protection System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ COMPLETE - All 3 Security Webhooks Implemented

Your Stripe webhook system now has comprehensive revenue protection against payment failures, refunds, and chargebacks.

---

## 🛡️ What Was Added

### 1. invoice.payment_failed Handler ✅

**Protects Against:** Users keeping paid access when their card expires or payment fails

**How It Works:**
```
Payment fails → Mark as 'past_due'
              → Keep plan active (allow Stripe retry)
              → After 4 failed retries → Stripe cancels subscription
              → customer.subscription.deleted fires
              → User downgraded during grace period
```

**Log Output:**
```
⚠️ PAYMENT FAILED: user@example.com - marked as past_due (Attempt 1)
   Invoice: in_1234567890, Amount: 14.00 GBP
```

**User Experience:**
- Sees "Payment failed - update your payment method" banner
- Keeps access during retry period (professional UX)
- Automatically downgraded if all retries fail

---

### 2. charge.refunded Handler ✅

**Protects Against:** Users getting refunds but keeping premium features

**How It Works:**
```
Refund issued → Immediately downgrade to Lite
              → Log admin alert with all details
              → User loses premium access instantly
```

**Log Output:**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🚨 REFUND ALERT - ADMIN ACTION MAY BE REQUIRED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Email: user@example.com
Previous Plan: core
Refund Amount: 14.00 GBP
Charge ID: ch_1234567890
Reason: requested_by_customer
Action Taken: Downgraded to Lite plan
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Why This Matters:**
Without this handler, users could:
1. Pay £14 for Core plan
2. Get refund from bank
3. Keep Core plan access
4. **You lose:** £14 + processing fees

---

### 3. charge.dispute.created Handler ✅

**Protects Against:** Chargebacks going unnoticed until revenue drops

**How It Works:**
```
Dispute filed → URGENT admin alert logged
              → Shows evidence deadline
              → Direct link to Stripe dashboard
              → Wait for resolution (don't downgrade yet)
              → If lost: charge.refunded fires automatically
```

**Log Output:**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🚨🚨🚨 URGENT: PAYMENT DISPUTE CREATED 🚨🚨🚨
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️  IMMEDIATE ADMIN ATTENTION REQUIRED ⚠️
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Email: user@example.com
Plan: core
Dispute Amount: 14.00 GBP
Dispute Reason: fraudulent
Dispute ID: dp_1234567890
Evidence Due: 2025-02-01T23:59:59.000Z
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Action: Review in Stripe Dashboard immediately
Link: https://dashboard.stripe.com/disputes/dp_1234567890
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Chargebacks cost £15-30 in fees (even if you win)
- High chargeback rates = Stripe account suspension risk
- You have 7-14 days to respond with evidence
- Early detection = better chance of winning
